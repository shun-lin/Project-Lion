# Project-Lion
The problem we are addressing is the long and manual process of loan approval workflow.The goal of our project is to build a model that classify the loan approval decision based on the loan application data with high accuracy. This will help automate the process of loan application review by the banks and investors. The stretch goal (if time permits) of our project is to build a recommendation system that help applicants make adjustments to their loan application to have a higher chance of getting their loan approved. The recommendation system will associate the current application with several similar approved loans and further identify the areas of the loan information at which may be improved for approval. This will help loan applications to get immediate and free loan application reviews that save both the time and money for the banks and for the applicants.
